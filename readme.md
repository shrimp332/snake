# Snake
Terminal Snake Game in Go

## Building
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shrimp332/snake
go build -o snake .
```
## Running
```sh
clear; snake 
```
Use clear or the game will just draw itself over the current content  
also it checks the terminal size at the start of the game, so you can't resize your terminal while playing
## Install
idk why you'd want to, but you can
```sh
go install github.com/shrimp332/snake@latest
```
